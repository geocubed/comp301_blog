      <div class="tilepage-title">Welcome to my blog</div> 
    </div>
    <p>Hello, fellow COMP 301 humans. Welcome to my blog! I will be posting my thoughts and comments about relevant topics discussed in class.</p>
    <p>You might be thinking... this UI looks very Apple, and you'd be right! I styled this site by hand using my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS to make this blog from scratch. I'm an Apple sheep, so I took their newsroom UI as inspiration. Web development is a hobby I took up a couple of years ago, and I spend some of my free time here and there exploring and troubleshooting my problems.</p>
      <p>In case anybody was curious, I use Visual Studio Code to write my code; I then push my commits to Github, then link my repo to Netlify to host my site using a domain name I bought years ago.</p>
      <p>Other techy-nerdy things about me: I use Firefox because I'm a part of the anti-chromium monopoly gang. I use iTerm2 with ohmyzsh for some snazzy-looking commands. I hate using my mouse to navigate the web and my operating system (MacOS), so I use ShortCat and VIMIUM. Lastly, I use Raycast because it's the superior spotlight alternative (in my personal opinion)</p>
      <p>If you also hate using the mouse, you are my friend. If you like using the mouse, you are also my friend, as long as it's not the Apple Magic Mouse.</p>
      <p>I think this is enough rambling. See you in my next post!</p>
