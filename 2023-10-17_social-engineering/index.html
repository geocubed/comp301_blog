      <h2>Proposition</h2>

      <p>Humans are the weakest link in any cyber-security system.</p>

      <h2>Stance</h2>

      <p>I agree with the proposition. I think that humans are the weakest link in any cyber-security system. I feel so because of several things, some of which are from the videos we watched for this blog post. </p>

      <p>In the first video, <a target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PWVN3Rq4gzw?si=hKbke6aohg7oXVFv">This Hacker Break into a Company</a>, David quickly exploited the good nature of humans to social engineer his way into his victim's company. I found this strategy to weaponize good faith to be very clever. His casual demeanour and claim to be bad at computers were natural and susceptible for a helper to think nothing of it.</p>

      <p>The second video, <a target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ck_r2GYLdCI?si=-uoNcsHfvkrSiQyJ">How Hackers Take Over Your Accounts Using Social Engineering (Marketplace)</a>, took it up a notch. The social engineers actually manipulated the Rogers account of the journalist. This was eye-opening; they changed sensitive settings with only some basic information. I thought it felt too easy for the social engineers to change the settings on Charlsie's account. This interaction reinforces my stance that humans are the weakest link. These two social engineers were able to use the good nature of humans, yet again, to gain access to something they should not have had in the beginning.</p>

      <p>I am an optimistic person. I like to help others whenever I can. Despite my intermediate tech-savyness, I see myself being a victim of social engineering if I were a front-line customer service rep. I believe there are many others just like me, and because of that, our security is in danger from those who know how to exploit that aspect of good-natured humans. I strongly agree that more education is required on this topic. Before writing this blog post, I only knew little about social engineering. I'm glad that I have become more knowledgeable on this topic.</p>
