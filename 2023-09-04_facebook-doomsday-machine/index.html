    </div>
      <h2>Proposition</h2>

      <p>The debate between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists is over -- Facebook is a doomsday machine. Social media platforms created the conditions and provided the means to organize the only breach of the US Capitol building in modern history.</p>

      <h2>Stance</h2>

      <p>I'd like to address the first stance. "Facebook is a doomsday machine." Assuming a doomsday machine, as the reading states it to be, "a device built with the sole purpose of destroying all human life," I disagree. I believe Facebook is just a tool that allows people to connect. I think Facebook's sole purpose is to connect people and make money by making people spend more time on their platform. Despite my optimistic view of Facebook's purpose, I cannot deny its tactics to draw people into its platform. Those tactics are discussed in the videos below and will be mentioned later in my blog.</p>

      <p>I find it weird that when I did a simple YouTube search for the relationship between Facebook and the Capitol Hill riot, two of the five videos that popped up were from CNN. I'm no CNN expert, so I can't comment anymore about that other than I found that pretty interesting. </p>

      <p>I agree with the second stance, "social media platforms created the conditions and provided the means to organize the only breach of the US Capitol building in modern history." Based on the videos and <a class="sources" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/facebook-capitol-riot-whistleblower-1.6198502">this</a> article I read (funnily enough from CNN again),  I agree that social media played a massive part in the breach. I think so because of the psychological tactics used to make people stay on Facebook. I too, find that negative and hateful content stirs up something in my mind more than positive content. What I'm referring to (in case you haven't watched the two videos above) is the tactic of Facebook pushing hateful groups to those who could be interested in those groups. I must admit, it is clever of Facebook; however, I feel their moral responsibility is now in question. I bet this makes us all question, what line will Facebook draw to keep you on their platform? The rapid, widespread nature of the internet allows these hateful groups to form very quickly, with infrastructure to disseminate information much more accessible than before the internet.</p>

      <p>Essentially, I agree that Facebook curated the conditions for hateful groups to form and provided a means for these groups to get together in exchange for more Facebook users and, consequently, more ads and more money.</p>
