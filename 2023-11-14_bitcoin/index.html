      <h2>Proposition</h2>

      <p>Bitcoin is not a viable currency because it requires an unsustainable amount of energy to process each transaction.</p>

      <h2>Stance</h2>

      <p>I agree with the proposition. Because Bitcoin consumes more power than cash, electricity is still being generated through combustion, and because of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, I believe Bitcoin is not a viable currency. </p>

      <p>Let's take a look at the definition of sustainable. A quick Google search says the purpose of sustainability is being "able to be maintained at a certain rate or level." Now, if we consider that, the fact that Bitcoin costs more energy to make than regular cash is an issue. If we imagine a world where one takes over another, it is obvious which one should stay. Assuming mining Bitcoin gets more challenging and complex and electricity becomes more and more expensive, Bitcoin mining doesn't sound so appealing, in my opinion. To counter that argument, perhaps newer processes will become too efficient and powerful, and the power draw will plateau, though I am uncertain of that future. Take the M series ARM chips Apple has been making over the years; they have become incredibly efficient and powerful.</p>

      <p>I would be more optimistic about cryptocurrencies if it weren't for the fact that they consume so much power. I get it: GPUs get hot, they need cooling, and the warehouse they operate out of needs electricity, further cooling, maintenance, and all that jazz. It just sucks that it still takes boiling water to spin a fan to make all that happen. In this Article from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/bitcoin-miners-revive-fossil-fuel-plant-co2-emissions-soared">Guardian</a>, Milman states that "cryptocurrency is fueling the climate crisis" as more and more power plants are being converted for mining purposes. He shows graphs indicating the rise in CO2 emissions after the change to crypto. There is still hope; <a target="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/whats-environmental-impact-cryptocurrency/" href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/whats-environmental-impact-cryptocurrency/">this</a> web page outlines the current environmental impact and possible ways crypto can be minted for cheaper. Investopedia states that crypto will most likely never be environmentally friendly based on the nature of the service, which is "energy-intensive, competitive, and rewards-based." By contrast, work is being done to eliminate 99.99% of carbon emissions by retiring the blockchain's proof-of-work mechanism, though it has yet to take effect. </p>

      <p>I do not want my Bitcoin to decrease in value overnight because of some social media posts. The cryptocurrency volatility, for me at least, is quite undesirable. It feels like gambling, but the house has a huge advantage. Dogecoin, for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/dogecoin-jumps-over-30percent-after-twitter-changes-logo-to-doges-symbol.html">example</a>, jumped more than 30% after Elon Musk changed the Twitter logo for a Shiba Inu. Now imagine you were one of those people who bought at the peak and watched it fall the next day. I understand the thrill of cryptocurrency, and I think it is fine, but when it becomes the primary source of monetary transactions instead of a side hobby, I see it as a risk. I don't believe Bitcoin is a viable cryptocurrency. </p>
