      <h2>Proposition</h2>
      <p>Virtually all marketing strategies seek to take advantage of human psychology. "Dark Patterns" in web and software designs are no different and need no regulation.</p>
      <h2>Stance</h2>
      <p>Firstly, I would like to address the first proposition, "Virtually all marketing strategies seek to take advantage of human psychology." I strongly agree that this is the case because that's what makes a "strategy." A strategy is a well-thought-out plan and approach to a task to reach an objective. Suppose a marketing strategy doesn't consider factors such as colour theory, strategic typography, target demographic, placement, and other psychological aspects of marketing. In that case, the ad will be unsuccessful and fail to deliver the optimal amount of traffic toward the company that put the ad up. Remember, the primary interactors of these marketing strategies are humans; it is entirely rational for a marketing strategy to leverage human psychology to maximize itself.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, I highly disagree that "dark patterns in web and software designs are no different and need no regulation." The reason I think dark patterns need regulation is because of their very predatory nature. Dark patterns do not exist for society's good; therefore, society should not have to deal with dark patterns. Dark patterns exist to disguise, hide, and manipulate society. Those adjectives are not favourable to society. It makes navigating the web and software more complex and can lead to accidental, unwilling transfers of money and personal information. Those who benefit from dark patterns collect what the user has given, which leads me to believe that dark patterns are a form of harvesting from those who are most vulnerable. These predatory actions are already addressed in the "False or misleading representations and deceptive marketing practices under the Competition Act." Because Canada already has regulations on deceptive marketing practices, why aren't dark patterns gone? That's because dark patterns exist online on an international scale. Canada simply doesn't have jurisdiction over sites that span a global scale; additionally, because of the use of vague language in dark patterns, one could argue that dark patterns are not deceptive at all and are simply a barrier to understanding from the user, making it not the companies responsibility for a user's education of language.</p>
      <p>Where do we go from now? There doesn't seem to be a way for online web services and software to enforce anti-dark pattern practices. It feels like the most we can do is protest with our wallets. Do not support any company that deals with dark pattern practices. Call the companies out on social media and publicly shame companies for practicing unethical UX. I'm glad dark patterns are getting more exposure. The more educated we are, the better!</p>
